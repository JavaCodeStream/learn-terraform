Hashicorp Vault
====================
- Hashicorp Vault is a separate product which allows organizations to securely store secrets like 
tokens, passwords, certificates, along access management for protecting secrets.

- these secrets can include database passwords, aws secret/access key, API tokens, encryption keys

- This is UI driven application, once installed, we can setup all of our secrets and
also configure them like auto rotate passwords, lease password for say 1 hr etc.


Terraform Vault provider
=========================
- Terraform has a provider to connect to hashicorp Vault.

- we can configure the vault provider in order to access to vault and get any secret
and use it on our terraform config file rather, declare them in plan text on TF config
file.

ex:

we have vault created: named db_creds on Hashicorp Vault.

a secret in vault is key/value pair.

admin/password123


Now, we can inject this password in terraform like below:

provider "vault" {
  address = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
}

data "vault_generic_secret" "demo" {
  path = "secret/db_creds"
}

output "vault_secrets" {
  value = data.vault_generic_secret.demo.data_json
  sensitive = "true"
}
