- HCL stands for Hashocorp Configuration Language.
- terraform configuration file extension is .tf
- a configuration file consits of multiple blocks. a contain multiple arguments.
- a block can be of different types. ex: resource, data etc.


<block> <parameters> {
    key1 = value1
    key2 = value2
}

- ex: we want to create a file on our lcal system.

local provider: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest/docs
local file resource: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/local/latest/docs/resources/file


local.tf
---------
resource "local_file" "my_file" {
    filename = "/root/my_file.txt"
    content  = "We love Pets"
}

here:
    - type of block is -> resource.
    - resource type: local_file, resource type provides 2 info. the provider name (local) before _ 
    and the resource (file) after _
    - resource name: the logical name (my_file) is the identify the resource and it can be named anything.
    - *** once terraform applied, even changing this logical resource name will also trigger 
    a change on consecutive terraform plan/apply. ***
    - within this resource block inside the curly braces, we define the arguments. written in 
    ket/value format. these args are specific to the type of resource we are creating.

ex: a resource block (aws_instance) for provisioning a EC2 instance on aws.

resource "aws_instance" "webserver" {
    ami = "ami-"
    instalce_type = "t2-micro"
}
