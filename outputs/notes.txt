Sensitive parameter on output 
===================================
- With organization managing their entire infra in terraform, it is likely that we will
some Sensitive info embedded in the code.

- When working with a field that contains info likely to be considered sensitive, it is best 
to set the sensitive property to true.

ex:

output "db_password" {
    values = aws_db_instance.db_password
    description = "password for DB login"
    sensitive = true
}


- setting the sensitive to 'true' will prevent the field's value from showing up in CLI 
output and in Terraform Cloud.

- BUT its will still be visible on terraform state file.


Hands-on
---------

locals {
  db_password = {
    admin = "password"
  }
}

output "db_password" {
  value = local.db_password
  sensitive   = true
}


$ terraform init



$ terraform apply 

Changes to Outputs:
  + db_password = (sensitive value)

You can apply this plan to save these new output values to the Terraform state, without changing any real infrastructure.
