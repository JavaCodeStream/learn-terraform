Terraform Provisioners
=====================================
- Till now, we used terraform to create AWS instance i.e. EC2 on aws. but that EC2 instance is empty. it does
not have any web server software (ex: nginx, apache etc) installed.

- what if we want a complete end to end sollution such that terraform not only creates
EC2 instance but it should also automatically configure a specific application, in our example
a web server in the newly created EC2 instance, so that once the instance is UP, our server is also
live to server request.

- Provisioners are used to execute scripts on a local or remote machine as part of resource creation or
destruction.
ex: on creation of EC2, execute script which will install Nginx web server.

Provisioner Types
