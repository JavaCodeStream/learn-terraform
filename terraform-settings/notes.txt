Terraform Settings
====================================================================
- The special terraform configuration block type is used to configure some behaviors 
of Terraform itself, such as requiring a minimum Terraform version to apply your configuration.


Terraform Block Syntax
------------------------
- Terraform settings are gathered together into terraform blocks:

terraform {
  # ...
}


- The various options supported within a terraform block are described in the following sections.

    - Configuring Terraform Cloud
        - The nested cloud block configures Terraform Cloud for enabling its CLI-driven run workflow.

    - Configuring a Terraform Backend
        - The nested backend block configures which state backend Terraform should use.

    - Specifying a Required Terraform Version
        terraform {
            required_version = "> 0.12.0"
        }

    - Specifying Provider Requirements
        - The required_providers block specifies all of the providers required by the current module.

        terraform {
            required_providers {
                aws = {
                version = ">= 2.7.0"
                source = "hashicorp/aws"
                }
            }
        }







terraform {
  required_version = "< 0.11"
  required_providers {
    aws = "~> 2.0"
  }
}
