- Files/Folders to ignore (not to git commit):
    - .terraform            :   This file gets re-created on terraform init run.
    - terraform.tfstate     :   should be stored in remote.
    - crash.log             :   if terraform crashed, logs are stored in crash.log file.
    - *.tfvars              :   in case, passwords are captured in terraform.tfvars or any custom tfvars file.
